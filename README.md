### Scope
This repository will gather software and tools to create experiments for free waveform diffusion encoded MRI, and to read such data and reconstruct the experiment. We intend to create both common tools (useful regardless of vendor and origin of pulse sequence), and tools that are specific to the MRI vendors and pulse sequence implementations. Naturally, we will focus on the implementations developed at Lund University (for SIemens and Philips), but we can also cover sequences developed by collaborators at other vendors.

### Note that the repo was renamed from "fwf_header_toos" to reflect the growing scope of the project
